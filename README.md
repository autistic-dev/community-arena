# arena.moi suck, let's built our own!

it's a nice phylosophy to built our own shovel if the one we have don't work *well*, and there is multiple answer of the WHY.

- arena.moi is unreachable *most* of the time
- implementing users suggested is rarely took into considuration!
- light-theme or gtfo
- why not?

and yeah light-theme or gtfo did hurt my eyes a little (talking about codeforces!) and **yes**, help would be appreciated, to understand how does this works, consider checking the HOWITWORKS.md for a linux-src style ASCII explanation!
